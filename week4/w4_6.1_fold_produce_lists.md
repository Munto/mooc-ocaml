# USING FOLD TO PRODUCE LISTS  (30 points possible)
The idea of this exercise is to write functions that iterate on lists, using the `fold_left` and `fold_right` functions from the `List` module.

1. Write a function `filter : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list` that takes a predicate `p` (a function returning a boolean) and a list `l` and returns all the elements of `l` that satisfy `p` (for which `p` returns `true`).

2. Define, using `List.fold_right`, a function `partition : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list * 'a list` that takes a predicate `p` and a list `l`, and that partitions `l` by `p`. It returns a pair of two lists `(lpos,lneg)`, where `lpos` is the list of all elements of `l` that satisfy `p`, and `lneg` is the list of all elements that do not satisfy `p`.

One way of sorting a list is as follows:
* The empty list is already sorted.
* If the list `l` has a head `h` and a rest `r`, then a sorted version of `l` can be obtained in three parts:
  * first a sorted version of all elements of `r` that are smaller or equal to `h`,
  * then `h`,
  * then a sorted version of all elements of `r` that are greater than `h`.

3. Write a function `sort:'a list-> 'a list` that implements this algorithm, using the function partition of the previous question. This sorting algorithm is also known as [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) where the pivot is always the first element of the list.

# YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```
let filter p l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation";;

let partition p l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation";;

let rec sort = function _ ->
  "Replace this string with your implementation";;
```
