# OPTIMIZING PARTIAL APPLICATIONS  (35 points possible)
Every triangle has a circumscribed circle, that is a circle that goes through the three points of a given triangle. Trigonometry tells us that the radius of this circle is ![s/(2⋅cos(a/2)⋅2⋅cos(b/2)⋅2⋅cos(c/2))](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cfrac%7Bs%7D%7B2%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ccos%20%28%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D%29%20%5Ccdot%202%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ccos%20%28%5Cfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D%29%20%5Ccdot%202%20%5Ccdot%20%5Ccos%20%28%5Cfrac%7Bc%7D%7B2%7D%29%7D) where `a`, `b` and `c` are the angles of the triangle, and `s` is its circumference.

1. Define a function `ccr: float -> float -> float -> float -> float` that takes as arguments `a`, `b`, `c` and `s`, and returns the radius of circumscribed circle as described above.

2. Update `ccr` so that it does as much work as possible when partially applied to each argument, and minimizes the total number of operations (multiplications, divisions and calls to `cos`).

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let ccr = fun a -> fun b -> fun c -> fun s ->
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
