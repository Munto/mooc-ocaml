# PRINTING LISTS  (200 points possible)

1. Write a function `print_int_list : int list -> unit` that takes a list of integers as input, and prints all the elements of the list, each on its own line.

2. Write a function `print_every_other : int -> int list -> unit` that takes a value `k` and a list of integers as input, and prints the elements of the list that are in positions multiple of `k`, each on its own line. Note: the first element of a list is at the position 0, not 1.

3. Write a function `print_list : ('a -> unit) -> 'a list -> unit` that takes a printer of values of some type `'a` and a list of such values as input, and prints all the elements of the list, each on its own line.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```

  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let print_every_other k l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec print_list print l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
