# IMPLEMENTING MUTABLE LISTS  (80 points possible)
Using mutable record fields, we can define the type of a list data structure with explicit pointers, as defined by the type `'a xlist` given in the prelude.

The empty list is written:

```ocaml
{ pointer = Nil }
```

The singleton list containing only `"one"` is written:
```ocaml
{ pointer = List (1, { pointer = Nil }) }
```

The list containing the elements `1`, then `2` then `3` is written:
```ocaml
{ pointer =
    List (1, { pointer =
                 List (2, { pointer =
                              List (3, { pointer =
                                           Nil }) }) }) }
```

1. Define `head : 'a xlist -> 'a` that returns the first element of the list if it exists, or fails with `Empty_xlist`. This function does not modify the list.
2. Define `tail : 'a xlist -> 'a xlist` that returns the list without its first element if it exists, or fails with `Empty_xlist`. This function does not modify the list.
3. Define `add : 'a -> 'a xlist -> unit` that modifies the list in place to add an element at the front.
4. Define `chop : 'a xlist -> unit` that modifies the list to remove its front element, or fails with `Empty_xlist`.
5. Define `append : 'a xlist -> 'a xlist -> unit`, a destructive concatenation operation that modifies the last pointer of the first list to point to the beginning of the second list.
6. Define `filter : ('a -> bool) -> 'a xlist -> unit`, a destructive filter operation on lists that removes from the list all elements that do not satisfy the boolean predicate passed as parameter.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```
type 'a xlist =
  { mutable pointer : 'a cell }
and 'a cell =
  | Nil
  | List of 'a * 'a xlist ;;

let nil () =
  { pointer = Nil } ;;

let cons elt rest =
  { pointer = List (elt, rest) } ;;

exception Empty_xlist ;;
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```
let head l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let tail l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let add a l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let chop l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec append l1 l2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec filter p l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
