# SIMPLE USES OF REFERENCES  (50 points possible)
1. Define `swap : 'a ref -> 'a ref -> unit` that swaps the contents of two references.
2. Define `update : 'a ref -> ('a -> 'a) -> 'a` that calls a function on the contents of a reference, updates it with the result, and returns the old value.
For instance `let r = ref 6 in update r (function x -> x + 1)` should return `6` and set the reference to `7`.
3. Define `move: 'a list ref -> 'a list ref -> unit`, that removes the top argument from the first list and puts it on top of the second list. If the first list is empty, it should `raise Empty`.
4. A common pattern is to use a reference to perform a computation in an imperative way, but to keep it in a local definition, completely invisible from outside the function implementation. Define `reverse: 'a list -> 'a list`, that has a type and an observable behaviour that look like the ones of a purely functional function, buf that use a reference internally to perform the computation. It takes a list, and returns a copy of the list whose elements are in reverse order. The only functions you can call, except from locally defined functions, are `(!)`, `(:=)`, `ref`, and `move` that you just defined. And you are not allowed to use pattern matching.

  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let move l1 l2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let reverse l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
