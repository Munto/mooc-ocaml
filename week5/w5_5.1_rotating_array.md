# ROTATING THE CONTENTS OF AN ARRAY  (22 points possible)
In this exercise, you will improve the code shown in the course (and given in the template) for rotating arrays.

1. There is something perfectible with the code of `rotate`.
Find what, and fix the function!.

2. Define `rotate_by: 'a array -> int -> unit` adding a parameter that allows to rotate by `n` positions.
For instance, `rotate_by [|1;2;3;4|] 3` should yield `[|4;1;2;3|]`.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```
let rotate a =
  let n = Array.length a in
  let v = a.(0) in
  for i = 0 to n-2 do
    a.(i) <- a.(i+1)
  done;
  a.(n-1)<-v ;;

let rotate_by a n =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
