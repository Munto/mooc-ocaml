# PRIME NUMBERS  (30 points possible)
Let's define some usual arithmetical functions.

1. `gcd` that takes two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and that returns the greatest common divisor of `n` and `m`, following Euclid's algorithm.
2. `multiple_upto : int -> int -> bool` that takes two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, and that tells whether `n` admits at least one divisor between `2` and `r`, inclusive. In other words that there exists a number `d >= 2` an`d <= r`, such that the remainder of the division of `n` by `d` is zero.
3. `is_prime` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether it is a prime number.

**Important note**: You can assume that both `integer_square_root` and `multiple_of` exist, and that they are correct answers to the [Simple functions over integers](w1_5.1_simple_functions_over_integers.md) exercise from the previous sequence.

Once `is_prime` works, you can try writing a new version of it which is self-contained (that contains all definitions of auxiliary functions as locally defined functions).

```ocaml
let gcd n m =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let multiple_upto n r =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let is_prime n =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
