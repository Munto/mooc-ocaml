# INTEGER IDENTIFIERS  (2 points possible)
Suppose that a variable `x` exists and is an integer.

Define a variable `x_power_8` that uses three multiplications to calculate `x` to the power of 8. The only function you are allowed to call is the `(*)` operator.

**Hint**: use auxiliary variables.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
let x = Random.int 9 + 1 (* not 0 *)
```
