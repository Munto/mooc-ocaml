# SIMPLE FUNCTIONS OVER STRINGS  (12 points possible)
Let's define two functions working with strings:

1. `last_character` that returns the last character of a string, assuming that the string argument is not empty;
2. `string_of_bool` that converts a boolean value to its string representation.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let last_character str =
  "Replace this string by your implementation." ;;

let string_of_bool truth =
  "Replace this string by your implementation." ;;
```
