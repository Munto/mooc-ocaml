# STRING IDENTIFIERS  (2 points possible)
Suppose that a variable `word` exists and is a string.

Define a variable `sentence` that uses 5 string concatenations to create a string containing 9 times `word`, separated by commas (`','`).

This time, experiment with defining local `let` ... `in`s to store the partial results.
